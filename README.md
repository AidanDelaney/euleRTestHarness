# euleR Test Harness

This project conducts a specific experiment to compare Euler diagram drawings drawn by the Venn/Euler and euleR algorithms.

## How to run

There's a makefile.  If you have [GNU R](https://www.r-project.org/) installed, then the makefile should "just work"(tm) so:

```sh
$ make
```

If you don't use make, then try

```sh
$ R src/test.R
```
